# ElevenLabs Mac App

## 🤖 AI-Generated Code Project

**Important Note:** This entire Mac application was generated using AI tools, specifically Cursor Composer and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. AI wrote all of the code for this project and therefore we don't endorse this code for its quality but rather as a proof of concept of what AI can do.
