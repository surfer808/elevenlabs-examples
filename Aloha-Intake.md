# Aloha Intake - Voice Intake Tool for Eye Doctors Hawaii

## Project Overview
Aloha Intake is a voice-based intake tool for Eye Doctors Hawaii, using ElevenLabs Conversational AI to guide patients through an intake form via voice. After the conversation is completed, the system sends a confirmation email using Resend to info@aisolutionshawaii.com.

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Voice AI**: ElevenLabs Conversational AI
- **Email Delivery**: Resend API
- **Hosting**: Local deployment (not using Vercel)

### Key Components
1. **Voice Conversation Interface**: Implements ElevenLabs Conversational AI for natural voice interaction
2. **Post-Call Webhook**: Processes conversation transcripts and triggers email notifications
3. **Email Notification System**: Sends formatted confirmation emails using Resend API

## Integration Points

### ElevenLabs Integration
- Uses ElevenLabs conversational AI agent to facilitate voice interactions
- Implements webhooks to receive conversation transcripts after completion

### Email System (Resend)
- **Domain**: aisolutionshawaii.com
- **Sender**: info@aisolutionshawaii.com
- **Implementation**: Direct Resend API integration (not SMTP)

## Recent Updates and Fixes

### Email Delivery Fix (2023-05-15)
- **Issue**: Emails were not being delivered after webhook completion despite verified domain and API keys
- **Investigation**: 
  - Confirmed webhook was firing correctly
  - Found implementation issue in how Resend API was being called
- **Fix**: 
  - Replaced nodemailer SMTP implementation with direct Resend API integration
  - Added comprehensive error logging
  - Created test scripts to verify email delivery
  - Added next.config.js to properly handle environment variables

## Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
```
# ElevenLabs Configuration
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=your_elevenlabs_agent_id

# Resend Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=info@aisolutionshawaii.com
```

## Testing
To test the email functionality:
1. Ensure environment variables are set
2. Run `node direct-email-test.js YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY` to test direct email sending
3. Run `node webhook-test.js` to simulate a webhook call and test the entire flow

## Deployment
Currently deployed locally rather than on Vercel to avoid unrelated layout issues.
